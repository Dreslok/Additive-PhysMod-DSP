# Haskell-Euterpea Audio Synthesis
This project uses Haskell DSL Euterpea's signal-level features for additive and physical modeling synthesis.
Specifically, Combines Fourier series to produce square, triangle, and sawtooth audio waveforms, as well as 
using Karplus-Strong string synthesis to model a plucked string.
The WAV outputs are included in the repository.
